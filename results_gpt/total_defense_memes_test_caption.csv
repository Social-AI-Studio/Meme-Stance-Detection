The term ""encik"" is a Malay word often used in the Singaporean and Malaysian military to refer to a warrant officer or a senior non-commissioned officer. The meme humorously suggests that while the officer might have denied leave (time off), there is still hope because the person has not yet asked their ""encik,"" implying that the encik might grant the leave request.

In the bottom half, titled ""WHAT WE THINK SCDF DOES,"" there is a single panel showing a character in a firefighter uniform, holding a cat and standing behind a podium with the acronym ""SCDF"" and the phrase ""The Life Saving Force"" on the front.

The joke is that while the SCDF does important work like saving lives, training, and community outreach, people might whimsically imagine them as heroes who also save cats, a common stereotype of firefighters.

The meme seems to be referencing a sentiment or behavior associated with Singaporean men on the 1st of July, possibly related to National Service (NS), which is mandatory military service in Singapore. ""HORMATSAF"" could be a play on words for saluting the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and the phrase ""Wah I miss NS days sia.."" suggests nostalgia for their time in National Service.

The meme seems to be making a political statement about inclusivity and diversity, suggesting that while there may be a general principle of non-discrimination based on race, language, or religion, this principle is not consistently applied in certain political contexts, such as presidential elections or prime ministerial positions. The mention of ""tokenism"" implies a critique of superficial or symbolic efforts at diversity without substantive change or representation.",1128,200

On the left side, the label reads ""Anime intro"" and shows a group of people in military attire, seemingly in a training or marching scenario, with a sunny background. On the right side, the label reads ""Anime outro"" and depicts a group of people standing in a dimly lit setting, which gives off a more somber or reflective mood. Below the right image, there is additional text that says ""New music video for Majulah Singapura,"" suggesting that the image is from a music video related to Singapore. The meme plays on the common trope that anime openings (intros) are often energetic and action-packed, while the endings (outros) are more mellow and emotional.",1128,156

The top image shows a man holding up a smartphone displaying a QR code, with the caption: ""WE MUST LEARN FROM CHINA TO BECOME CASHLESS.""

The middle image features a young child with a skeptical expression, and the caption reads: ""YOU DON'T KNOW MEH?"" This caption uses the colloquial term ""meh,"" which is often used in Singaporean English to express disbelief or to question the validity of a statement.

The bottom image shows the same man as in the top image, but this time he is wiping his forehead with a handkerchief, looking stressed or exasperated. The caption for this image says: ""MANY SINGAPOREANS ALREADY CASHLESS BEFORE MONTH END.""

At the very bottom of the meme, there is a logo with the text ""KUANYEVISM,"" which seems to be a play on words, possibly referencing a specific ideology or perspective, but without additional context, the exact meaning is unclear.

The overall joke of the meme seems to be a play on the concept of ""cashless"" society, with the punchline suggesting that many Singaporeans find themselves without cash before the end of the month, not due to the adoption of digital payments, but because they have run out of money. The child's skeptical response in the middle image serves as the setup for the punchline, questioning the initial statement about going cashless.",1128,301

1. At the top, there is a text excerpt that appears to be from a Bloomberg article. It reads: ""Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says LGBTQs are 'valued' and welcome in Singapore, despite his government's resistance to decriminalize homosexuality.""

2. Below the text, there is an image of a figurine with an exaggerated, disgruntled facial expression. The figurine is bald, has furrowed brows, wide eyes, and a frown, which conveys a sense of skepticism or disbelief.

The caption below the figurine reads: ""LGBTQ folks in Singapore.""

The meme seems to be using the figurine's skeptical expression to humorously comment on the perceived contradiction between the Prime Minister's statement of LGBTQ individuals being ""valued"" and welcome, and the government's resistance to decriminalize homosexuality, suggesting that LGBTQ people in Singapore might be skeptical or critical of the Prime Minister's statement. The watermark ""@sgmuseummemes"" suggests that the meme was created by an account focused on Singapore-related content, possibly with a cultural or historical angle.",788,230

On the left side, there is a close-up of a cat's face with a military-style cap photoshopped onto its head. The text above the cat reads ""NSFs hoping for a livable 'allowance' for conscription."" NSF likely stands for National Service Full-time, referring to conscripts in Singapore's mandatory military service.

On the right side, there is a man sitting on a bench, looking slightly distressed or exasperated, with his hands up as if he's explaining or defending himself. The text above him reads ""Singaporeans."" Below him, there are two opposing concepts labeled ""Minimum Wage vs PWM."" PWM likely refers to the Progressive Wage Model, which is a wage system in Singapore that aims to increase wages through skills upgrading and productivity growth.

The meme seems to be commenting on a socio-political issue in Singapore, contrasting the desires of conscripts for a higher allowance with a broader debate on wage policies among Singaporeans. The cat's exaggerated close-up and the man's expressive gesture suggest a humorous or ironic take on the tension between these two topics.",1128,228
/content/drive/MyDrive/stance_detection_datasets_GPT/total_defense_memes/TD_Memes/img_6587.jpg,"['Military Defence', ['Against', 'Against']]",Military Defence,"['Against', 'Against']",Against,"The meme features an image from the Star Wars prequel films, showing the characters Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The text above the image is a conversation that plays on generational differences and attitudes:

- Boomers: Cookhouse food damn lousy, we want better food!
- MINDEF: *gives the new generation better food*
- Boomers: STRAWBERRY GENERATION! DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPERIENCE HARDSHIP!

Below the text, there's a caption from the character Anakin Skywalker that reads, ""Hold on. This whole operation was your idea.""

The meme humorously points out the contradiction where the older generation (referred to as ""Boomers"") complains about the quality of food, but when the authorities (referred to as ""MINDEF,"" which could stand for a Ministry of Defense or similar organization) improve the food for the younger generation, the older generation criticizes them for not experiencing hardship. The image of Anakin is used to highlight the irony of the situation, as his line in the movie contextually suggests a realization of a plan backfiring or an unexpected turn of events.",788,234

1. The first section has the caption ""What the gahment says:"" with an image of a man in a pink shirt speaking. There is a subtitle on the image that reads, ""As Singaporeans, we must judge a person not just by his educational qualifications.""

2. The second section has the caption ""What my parents says:"" with an image of a smiling man in a suit. The text superimposed on the image says, ""Seriously how did he get into RI? Must be a lousy school.""

3. The third section has the caption ""What I rly wna say:"" with an image of a person covering their face with their hand, seemingly tired or exasperated. The text superimposed on the image says, ""I don't care, I just want to sleep.""

The meme is a humorous take on different perspectives regarding education and societal expectations, with the ""gahment"" (a colloquial spelling of ""government"") promoting a holistic view of a person, parents having high expectations and being critical of educational institutions, and the individual expressing a desire to disregard the conversation and rest instead.",788,247
