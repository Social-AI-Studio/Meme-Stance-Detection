Above the image, there is text that reads, ""When a HDB flat finishes its 99-year lease:"" which is a reference to the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore that are typically leased for 99 years.

Below the image of the building, there is a speech bubble with a stylized, colorful font that says, ""This is SO sad,"" followed by another line of text that reads, ""can we hit pedestrians with scooters?"" Additionally, there is a character with sunglasses and a smirk, which seems to be a stylized representation of a person, but not a specific individual. The character is not a known animated character and appears to be part of the meme's attempt at humor.

The meme is satirical in nature, combining a dramatic visual of a building disintegrating with a seemingly unrelated and irreverent question about hitting pedestrians with scooters, which is likely meant to mock the types of trivial or insensitive responses sometimes seen on social media in the face of more serious topics. The overall tone of the meme is absurd and humorous.",,788,248

On the left side, there is a classical painting depicting two ancient philosophers, who appear to be in a deep and serious discussion. The text above this image reads ""Talking about race with Indian and Malay Singaporeans.""

On the right side, there is a photograph of an adult woman playing with a young child, who is sitting at a table. They seem to be engaged in a simple and playful activity. The text above this image reads ""Talking about race with Chai knees Singaporeans.""

The meme is playing on the contrast between a serious, philosophical discussion and a light-hearted, childlike approach to a topic. The term ""Chai knees"" is a pun on the word ""Chinese,"" intentionally misspelled to sound like ""knees,"" which is a play on words to match the childlike theme of the right side of the meme. The meme suggests a difference in the level of discourse or sensitivity when discussing race with different groups of Singaporeans.",,448,203

The arms and the handshake are the central visual elements. Overlaid on the image is text that appears to represent two different phrases or types of slang. On the left side, the text reads ""wa damn shag bro,"" and on the right side, it reads ""aiya downpes sua."" Above the handshake, there is another line of text that says ""making up 90% of NSF vocabulary.""

The meme seems to be poking fun at the specific jargon or slang that is commonly used among National Service Full-time (NSF) personnel, which is a term used in some countries like Singapore to refer to conscripted military servicemen. The handshake could symbolize the camaraderie or shared experience among those in the service, often characterized by their unique lingo. The phrases in the meme are likely examples of this colloquial language, although without context, their exact meanings might be unclear to those not familiar with the slang.",,788,206
/content/drive/MyDrive/stance_detection_datasets_GPT/total_defense_memes/TD_Memes/img_4127.jpg,"['Social Defence', ['Neutral', 'Neutral']]",Social Defence,"['Neutral', 'Neutral']",Neutral,"The meme is titled ""The Chinese starter pack"" and features a collection of images that are meant to humorously represent stereotypical aspects associated with Chinese culture. The images include:

1. A paper with a red mark showing ""100/100"", suggesting a stereotype about academic excellence.
2. A traditional Chinese deity figure adorned with red and gold colors, which is often associated with wealth and prosperity in Chinese culture.
3. A pair of hands using chopsticks, which are common eating utensils in Chinese cuisine.
4. A man performing a martial arts kick, referencing the cultural significance of martial arts in China.
5. A queue of people at ""SINGAPORE POOLS"", which is a company that operates lottery and betting in Singapore, possibly alluding to a stereotype about gambling.
6. A large number of incense sticks burning, which is a common practice in Chinese religious and traditional ceremonies.

At the bottom, there is a caption that reads, ""Well, we must be equal in our satire, so here goes... -Chinese admin,"" which suggests that the creator of the meme is acknowledging the use of satire and is possibly of Chinese descent or representing a Chinese perspective. The meme uses humor to play on cultural stereotypes and is a form of social commentary.",,278,254

He appears to be in a crowd of people. The text overlay on the image reads ""when you realise NDP only happens once a year & you need to wait 364 days for the next one."" Below the image, there is a caption that says ""find someone that cares for you as much as this man cares for Singapore."" Additionally, there is a watermark that says ""Majulah Singapura,"" which is Malay for ""Onward Singapore"" and is the national anthem of Singapore. The logo ""SGAG"" suggests that this meme was created or shared by a social media page or group by that name. The meme humorously suggests that the man is extremely passionate about the National Day Parade (NDP), a significant event in Singapore, and that his level of care and anticipation for this event should be a benchmark for personal relationships.",,448,189
