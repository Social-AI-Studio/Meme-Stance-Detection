The text on the meme reads: ""When you've got a 98% chance of surviving the China virus MSM: Just get in the coffin."" The ""China virus"" refers to the COVID-19 virus, which originated in Wuhan, China. The mainstream media, or MSM, is a term used to describe traditional media outlets such as newspapers, TV news programs, and radio stations. The implication of the meme is that the media tends to sensationalize or overhype stories about the virus, leading people to feel惧 or anxious about it.","other
